Open Bugz:
	- Sometimes I get a java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. Hard to say at what times exactly. Seems like it just happens sometimes,
	the client doesn't crash or anything. None of my files are mentioned in the error log.
	
	
	
Closed:
	- When exiting multiple connections, the second one doesn't exit properly. the server never gets told the client is leaving.
		- Solved. I was removing stuff from an array I was looping through, makes things weird.
